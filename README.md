# Sarcasm Modeling & Prediction
This repository holds the code and reports used for the Humor & Sarcasm Detection project created for the Fall 2019
Statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) class at New York University.

This project sought to classify [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) as sarcastic or non-sarcastic using a suite of NLP models
including BERT, Keras with Tensorflow, and sklearn with Python. See the final report `reports/final_report.pdf` for details 
on the project and its conclusions.
